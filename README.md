## Overview

This document outlines the core rules, features, special moves, and end-game conditions. It also describes the user interface interactions, including menus and game options, and touches on the implementation of AI using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

## Game Rules and Features

### Basic Rules

1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on an 8x8 square board, with each player starting with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
2. **Piece Movement**:
    - **Pawn**: Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally. On its first move, it can choose to move forward two squares.
    - **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
    - **Knight**: Moves in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular.
    - **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
    - **Queen**: Combines the power of the rook and bishop, moving any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    - **King**: Moves one square in any direction.

### Special Moves

1. **Castling**: A move involving the king and either of the player's original rooks. Conditions for castling:
    - Neither the king nor the chosen rook has previously moved.
    - There are no pieces between the king and the chosen rook.
    - The king is not currently in check, does not pass through check, and does not end up in check.
2. **En Passant**: A pawn capturing move that can only occur immediately after an opponent moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and there is an adjacent pawn able to capture it as if it had moved only one square forward.
3. **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (usually a queen).

### End-Game Conditions

1. **Check**: The king is under immediate threat of capture. The player must make a move that eliminates the threat.
2. **Checkmate**: The player's king is in check, and there is no legal move to remove the king from threat. The game is over.
3. **Stalemate**: The player whose turn it is has no legal move, and their king is not in check. The game is drawn.
4. **Draw Conditions**:
    - Agreement: Both players agree to a draw.
    - Insufficient material: Neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate.
    - Fifty-move rule: Fifty consecutive moves have been made by both players without any pawn movement or capture.
    - Threefold repetition: The same board position is repeated three times with the same player to move.

## User Interface

### Main Menu

- **Play**: Start a new game.
- **Choose Side**: Allows the player to choose between playing as white or black.
- **Exit**: Quit the application.

### In-Game Menu (Accessible with the ESC Key)

- **Resume Game**: Return to the ongoing game.
- **New Game**: Reset the board and start a new game.
- **Main Menu**: Return to the main menu.
- **Exit Game**: Exit the application.

## AI Implementation

- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI will use the minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves, considering various depths to forecast possible outcomes.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: To optimize the minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning will be implemented to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, improving efficiency.

## Additional Features

- **Save/Load Game**: Allows players to save their current game state and load it later.
- **Undo Move**: Permits players to undo their last move. This feature may be limited in use to ensure fair play against the AI.
- **Game Timer**: Optional timers for each player to add a time constraint to the game, making it more challenging.

## Technical Requirements

- **Language and Framework**: The game will be developed in Kotlin using the Jetpack Compose for Desktop framework.
- **AI Difficulty Levels**: The game will offer various difficulty levels, adjusting the depth of the minimax algorithm and possibly incorporating heuristic evaluations for more advanced levels.
